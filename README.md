Downloading all the graphics packs only works through the git client, using the zip option on this page will net you an empty file.
If you want to grab one of the packs from this repo, click on the name and download .zip from there. You can also use the [release tab](https://github.com/Lazy-Newb-Pack/DFgraphics/releases) to grab an older version.

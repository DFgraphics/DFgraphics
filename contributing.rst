Introduction for new contributors
#################################


Welcome!
========
It's great that you're here - without an active community, these packs
simply wouldn't exist.  This page is a short guide for first-time
contributors who want to share their changes or updates to a graphics
pack, and takes you through all the tools and processes that we use.


Nope, way too complicated
=========================
Too hard?  Just get in touch with an active member of the project,
send us any files you changed, and we'll work out the rest.


.. note::
    TODO - write the actual content of this page


Dwarf Fortress Graphics
=======================
Key wiki pages etc.  Point to the `contributing-artists` page.

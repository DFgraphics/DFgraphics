DFGraphics is an organisation dedicated to creating and maintaining
beautiful tilesets for `Dwarf Fortress <http://bay12games.com/dwarves>`_,
which are fun for users and creators alike!

You can `read the full documentation HERE <https://dfgraphics.readthedocs.org>`_.
This includes installation instructions, though we recommend using a
`preconfigured Starter Pack <https://dwarffortresswiki.org/Lazy_Newb_Pack>`_.

Contributions of any kind - graphics, raws, bugfixes, new content,
documentation... - are all very welcome!  Feel free to make a
pull request, or ask in the Bay12 thread if you need anything.
